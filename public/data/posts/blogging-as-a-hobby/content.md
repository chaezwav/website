I think everyone can understand what I mean when I say hobbies are important. Whether, it’s playing a sport, playing
video games, or even something as out there as [insect fighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect_fighting), we all
have one and it helps us fulfill our very limiting 24 hours a day. I mean, who can even figure out what to do in all
that time?

Being given these options is both a blessing and a curse for an indecisive teenage mind. With hundreds of thousands of
possibilities it really takes time and dedication to find YOUR hobby. I mean some people luckily found that early on in
their life and still continue with it through their adult journey, but I, on the other hand, still don’t have a hobby I
can call mine!

This is the point in which I decided to explore blogging. A small medium for a corner of the web. A way to express
yourself without limitation. No word limits, no moderation. Just you, a markdown file - or other data format -, and your
word. Not Jeff’s words in reply to your post, and not your mother’s Facebook posts about your entire life. It can be as
complex as you’d like it to be or as simple - 2 words or 1,000. This alone was inspiring, motivating even.

I see this as a journey for myself - a way to find my interests and grow with them. A medium I can find myself delving
into when I’m bored or when I can’t fight the urge to stop.

Eventually, I plan to migrate off of Pika, because I do hope to have a website that I can call my own… but that’s for
another day. Unfortunately I am not the most brilliant web developer to reign the Earth, so that day might be tomorrow,
or…. 10 years from now. But that’s a future me problem!

If you’re reading this, I’d like to say thank you for reading my short little blog post. This is the first of (
hopefully) many in the future, and I can confidently say that today, October 25th, 2024 at 11:39 PM EST, marks the
beginning of many.

Thank you.
