After lots of hard-work, I've finally begun to settle down on a site that I'm happy with. A theme I like, a layout I like, an everything I like. I'm super excited for what's to come of this.

Things I added tonight:
- [Atom Feed](https://koehn.lol/feed.xml)
- Last.FM integration
- Status.lol integration
