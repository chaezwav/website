# My Personal Website

Hi! This is the GitHub/Git repository for my personal website. This is kind of an experiment/hobby project to learn about PHP and give me something to do in my free time.

## Features

- **Home Page**: A brief introduction to me and my interests.
- **Listening Page**: The last 10 songs I've listened to (via Last.fm).
- **Blog**: Anything I want to write when I feel like it
- **Temp**: Just a place to publicly test code
- **Integration of 2 channels**: Production and testing with a banner to show.

## Configuration

You need a `private` directory in the root of the project with the following files:

- `config.php`: Your secrets and config settings with the following:
```php
<?php

const ROOT_DIR = "";
const LASTFM_API_KEY = "";
const CHANNEL = "dev";
const TRACKING_ID = "";
```
- `data`: A directory to store data files
  - `api`: Where the apis will write to
  - `content/posts`: Where the blog posts are stored
- `temp`: A directory to store temporary scripts

## Hosting

I use Caddy as my webserver, but anything works. Just make sure you route your traffic to `/public/index.php` and have PHP installed.

My Caddyfile looks like this:
```
:80 {
    root * public/
    encode gzip
    php_fastcgi localhost:9000
    file_server
}
```
