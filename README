# My Personal Website

Hi! This is the GitHub/Git repository for my personal website. This is kind of an experiment/hobby project to learn about PHP and give me something to do in my free time.

## Features

- **Home Page**: A brief introduction to me and my interests.
- **Listening Page**: The last 10 songs I've listened to (via Last.fm).
- **Blog**: Anything I want to write when I feel like it
- **Temp**: Just a place to publicly test code
- **Integration of 2 channels**: Production and testing with a banner to show.

## Configuration

You need a `private` directory in the root of the project with the following files:

- `config.php`: Your secrets and config settings with the following:

  ```php
  <?php

  const CHANNEL = '[dev|prod]';
  const ROOT_DIR = '[full path]';
  const LASTFM_API_KEY = '[key from last.fm]';
  const TRACKING_ID = "[umami tracking id]";
  const MASTODON_TOKEN = "[access key from mastodon]";
  const MASTODON_INSTANCE = "[mastodon instance ROOT URL (i.e https://social.lol)]";
  ```
